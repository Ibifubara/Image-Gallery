# Image gallery

This project was a code along from Traversy media's Video  [React & Tailwind CSS Image Gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiGmAI5e91M).

## What I did differently

### API

- Used a differnt api from what he used
- According to the api's documentation, I had to call it differently and I did just that. Found my way around it for the most part.

### Tailwind and PostCss integration

- Used the current documentation on the tailwind website to do it

## To be improved on

### Design

- Overall layout and design of the page

### API

- Had to do a by pass for the .map and .length to work, will check thoroughly for the proper way to read the API
